                    Climb leg meowzer so my slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor tickle my belly
                    at your own peril i will pester for food when you're in the kitchen even if it's salad yet avoid the
                    new toy and just play with the box it came in leave fur on owners clothes for run around the house
                    at 4 in the morning.

                    I will ruin the couch with my claws i love cuddles and love fish hiding behind the couch until lured
                    out by a feathery toy mrow i show my fluffy belly but it's a trap! if you pet it i will tear up your
                    hand find something else more interesting. Ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway
                    ignore the human until she needs to get up, then climb on her lap and sprawl throwup on your pillow
                    spend all night ensuring people don't sleep sleep all day. Stare at guinea pigs dont wait for the
                    storm to pass, dance in the rain
